- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucBEER(SMANS)
     I'm a retired independant informatic, actually 74 years (Born 1947).  
     Logical and simple thinking is my force.
     I usted to program Fortran, Basic, Cobol and in the "beginning of computers" Assembler.
     I feel lucky to have seen the evolution of informatics.
     In 1970 I studied the source of a realtime-operatig-system. Learned a lot
     about DMA-channel, IO-interrupts, memory management and caching techniques etc.
     Since the late 70's I got familiar with the MPE-operating system on the HP3000-systems,
     leading to a famous expertise with all the OS itself and all of the available subsystems.
     (MPE=Multi Program Executive version 1.0 to 7.5: THE most stable and yet most flexible OS ever.)
     In 1978 I, as team-manager, developed the LABOPACK to serve the admin of a medical labo, 
     with a team of 8 programmers. The LaboPack "lasted" from 1978 until june 2006 ie 28 years ... 
     Not bad as a record I guess?
     
- 👀 I’m interested in all kind of utility programs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to get familiar with the options within all 
      of the current OS's, like  Win10, Android 5.0-10.0, iOS 5-13, ...
      
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on issuing standard-requirements and -options within
      programs/apps. Example:  Add, change, and remove should be visible/available at
      the same spot within a app/program!!!
